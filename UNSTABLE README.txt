The commits where this file is present are not production grade.

They contain in-development code to implement new features of Miosix, in particular the high-resolution timing infrastructure.

They are known to break compiling on any architecture but the ones where development was done, namely:
- stm32f407vg_stm32f4discovery
- efm32gg332f1024_wandstem

In addition, other bugs may be present.

This file will be removed once the code is back to being production grade.
